  <p>About UTAS-Shinas
The University of Technology and Applied Sciences-Shinas, formerly Shinas College of Technology (ShCT), is located in the Wilayat of Shinas in the Governorate of Batinah, about 69 kms from the city of Sohar, in the Sultanate of Oman. The university is a public institution catering to higher educational needs of Omani youths. It offers programs leading to diploma, advanced diploma and bachelor in the fields of Engineering, Information Technology and Business Studies.
 
The institution was established in December 2005 under the name of Shinas College of Technology. In 2020, a Royal decree transferred the colleges of technology into a university status. It started with 550 students and 15 staff to reach now around 3500 students and around 400 staff. The University of Technology and Applied Sciences at Shinas has undergone rapid growth, offering programs to suit the market needs.
 
In the previous academic year 2019/2020, we have introduced new approach for curriculum and increased the number of books at our library and made available thousands of electronic books and millions of research Articles for our students and staff. The university is asserting itself as a progressive, forward looking academic institution in Oman. The level of studentsâ€™ participation in national and international competitions and award-wining projects has witnessed a significant increase from the previous year. We represented the Sultanate in Huawei competition for the third consecutive years in China and we managed to double research funds from The Research Council.
 
Our Courses and workshops offered to the community and industry reached more than a thousand beneficiaries, an increase of around 50% from the previous year. We provided courses in different fields, English learning, network security, business development, industrial revolution and many others. We pride our self in our sustainable relationship with the community and industry.</p>
